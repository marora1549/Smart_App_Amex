# SMART â€“ STRATEGIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND REPORTING TOOL

## ABOUT THE APP-## [Flutter Code base for the APP](https://github.com/marora1549/Smart_App_Amex)

- We have developed a robust end-to-end Strategic Financial Management tool for SMEs in the form of an easy-to-use mobile app that caters to all the financial needs of Small and Medium sized Business Owners. Once the business owner completes the digital onboarding process, (s)he can start using the app. 

- The app offers a wide variety of Financial Management tools ranging from budget planners & resource allocation managers to in-app paperless Loan applications with smart credit risk assessment tools embedded into the app which tracks traditional data like monthly expenses, credit history, etc. along with modern data points like the digital presence of the business to churn out a comprehensive report on the creditworthiness of that SME.

- Built-in Analytics offered by the app not only identifies the gap in the current capital but also suggests the best solutions for dealing with that gap such as Government Grants, Short term loans, and other credit solutions which might prove to be beneficial to the user. The objective of the app is to make loan applications hassle-free, thus we have provided it a very user-friendly and intuitive design.

- On the AMEX side, we have also built a Web-based dashboard where all the financial aid applications from various businesses along with details like Credit Score, Revenue, Expenses, Standing in the Industry etc are visible for a complete end-to-end proof of concept.
